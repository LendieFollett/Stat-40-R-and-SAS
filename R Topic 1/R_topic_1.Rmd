# Why R?

* R and Python are the most common languages used in data science

--
* R is open source - this means:
  1. It is free, which is cool.
  2. You have access to the code behind the functions you are using on your data

--
* The entire data science / statistics / computer science community contributes to R's development through *packages*

--
* R is very flexible and, thus, powerful. If you can program it, you can do it.

# Getting Started
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="70%",out.height="50%",fig.cap="RStudio interface",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("Images/R_t1_rstudio.png"))

y <- c(6.2, 4.9, 1.1)
x <- 40
``` 
???

Have the students open Rstudio

## R is a calculator
Here's a list of a few mathematical tasks and code translations:
.pull-left[
#####  $x = 40$ (assigning $x$ the value of 40)
#####  $y = \begin{bmatrix} 6.2 & 4.9 & 1.1 \end{bmatrix}$ (create vector y)
#####  $2x$ (x times 2)
#####  $\sum^3_{i = 1} y_i = 6.2 + 4.9 + 1.1$ (sum up the matrix)
##### $x^2$ (take x to $2^{nd}$ power)
##### $y_2$ (taking $2^{nd}$ element of y)
]

.pull-right[
#####  `x <- 40`
#####  `y <- c(6.2, 4.9, 1.1)`
#####  `2*x`
#####  `sum(y)`
##### `x^2`
##### `y[2]`
]

???

Tip: be very explicit/clear with your mathematical operators. e.g., 2*x instead of 2x.

## Functions

* R has many ready-to-use functions
* Usually, the name of the function is self explanatory
* Functions require *arguments* inside the parentheses

```{r,eval=FALSE}

function_name(argument1, argument2)

```

## Functions

* Usually, the name of the function is self explanatory
* Functions require *arguments* inside the parentheses
```{r,eval=FALSE}

function_name(argument1, argument2)

```

* You supply the argument(s) - for example,

```{r fun, echo=TRUE}
#square root of any real number
sqrt(9)
#what happens if we supply a vector as the argument?
sqrt(y)

```

## Functions

* R has many ready-to-use functions
* Usually, the name of the function is self explanatory
* Functions require *arguments* inside the parentheses
```{r,eval=FALSE}

function_name(argument1, argument2)

```


* Some arithmetic functions: `sqrt(), sin(), cos(), exp(), log()`. These will apply themselves to each element of the vector.

* Some summary functions: `mean(), sum(), var(), min(), max(), length()`. These will reduce a vector to a single summary statistic (to a vector of length 1).
```{r}
mean(y)
sum(y)
```

---

## Functions

* If you're unsure about what a function does, ask R. 
* For example, create a vector consisting of a regular sequence of numbers using the `seq()` function

```{r}
#simply type a "?" before the function name
?seq
#SURPRISE ATTACK YOUR TURN:
#how would I generate a vector containing a sequence
#of 10 evenly spaced numbers ranging from 1 to 200?
```


*There are MANY functions in R. We won't even scratch the surface in classtime. *

# Getting Started

Open a *script* - typing in the console is fine to start with but we will put code we want to save into a script.
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="70%",out.height="50%",fig.cap="RStudio Interface",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("Images/R_t1_rstudio3.png"))


``` 
???

Have the students open Rstudio. 

Re-do some of the calculations under the comment 'R is a calculator'

Save the script together as in_class_intro.R

## Your Turn

For this Your Turn, keep working within `in_class_intro.R`. 

In machine learning, we often have to calculate the *mean squared difference between two vectors*. Say we have these two vectors:

* $a = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 &5\end{bmatrix}$ and $b = \begin{bmatrix} 2.2 & 4.5 & 7.2& 4.9 \end{bmatrix}$

Calculate $\frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=1}^4(a_i - b_i)^2$. 

(You may recognize this as being closely related to the Euclidean distance. )

---
## Logical Operators
* We can use R to make comparisons using *logical operators*
* A statement using *logical operators* will return a *logical value*: `TRUE` or `FALSE`
* Logical operators:

##### `==` equal
##### `!=` not equal
##### `<, >` less than, greater than
##### `<=, >=` less than or equal to, greater than or equal to
##### `%in%` appears in the following 

*Note we need a double equal sign to assess whether two things are equal!*

---
## Case Study

In the last your turn you created two objects `a` and `b` - you should see them in your Environment in the top right hand the RStudio window. 

1. Calculate the mean of `a` and save it as `mean_a`
2. Calculate the mean of `b` and save it as `mean_b`
3. Create a new variable `is_a_bigger` which is TRUE if `a` is bigger than `b`, on average, and FALSE otherwise
4. Create a new vector, the same length as `a` and `b`, for which the $i^{th}$ element is TRUE if $a_i > b_i$, and FALSE otherwise.

## Naming things

* We've already named a few objects. (`a, b, x, y, is_a_bigger`, ...)
* Recall, we name an object whenever we use the *assignment operator* (`<-` or `=`).
```{r,eval=FALSE}
object_name <- object_value
```
* Generally, it is good practice to come up with MEANINGFUL and DISTINCT names
* One important thing to remember (especially if you're getting errors): R is case sensitive! e.g., (`a` and `A` are considered distinct objects.

* R has some naming conventions:

  * The first character of the name must be an UPPER or lower case letter (A-Z, a-z). After that, characters can be:

    * UPPER/lower case letters 
    
    *  underscore (\_) and digits 0-9
   
    * period (.), unlike in SAS

* So, for example, `1x` is not a valid name, but `x1` would be


---
## Commenting your code

* As always, it's good practice to comment code
* You can comment *one line at a time* by starting the line with a "\#". 
* (As oppose to block commenting in SAS with /**/, which can perform multi-line comments)

```{r boring-comment}

#I like to comment as I code
#it helps future-me remember what
#I was thinking

#assign x the value pi (approx. 3.14)
#x <- pi 

#nevermind, assign x the logical value of (pi > 3)
x <- pi>3

```

???
go back and comment the your turn code together
